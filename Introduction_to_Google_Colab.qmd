- Understand what Google Colab is and its advantages for data science and AI  
- Learn how to access and navigate Google Colab  
- Create and manage notebooks in Google Colab  
- Run Python code in Colab cells  
- Use text cells for explanations and formatting  
- Import and use pre-installed libraries for data analysis  
- Import and use data to perform analysis  
- Share Colab notebooks  

## Introduction

Google Collaboratory, or Colab for short, is a free online platform that allows you to work with Python or R code in your browser. It's a great way to get started with Python, as you don't have to install anything on your computer.

Some limitations exist when running heavy workloads, such as session timeouts. However, for beginner data analysts, it is powerful, accessible, and free.

Note that this document is a summary of the video rather than a replacement. You should watch the video for a more complete experience.

## Getting Started With Colab

- Search for "Google Colab" in your favorite search engine  
- Usually the first result will be the correct one  
- Currently, the URL is https://colab.research.google.com  
- Sign in with your Google account (create a Gmail account if needed)

## Creating and Managing Notebooks

- Notebooks are the main way to organize work in Colab  
- They contain code cells and text cells  
- Create a new notebook: File → New Notebook  
- Rename your notebook for better organization

## Working With Code Cells

- Use the buttons at the top left to add code or text cells  
- Code cells are where you write and execute Python code  
- Type the following in a cell:

```python
1 + 1
```

- Run a cell by clicking the play button or using shortcuts:  
  - Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or Command + Enter (Mac)  
  - Shift + Enter to run and create a new cell below  

- The first run may take a moment while the Python engine initializes  
- The final output appears below the cell  
- To show multiple outputs, use print():

```python
print(1)
print(2)
```

## Text Cells

- Text cells are used for explanations and titles  
- Formatting uses Markdown syntax

## Example of Working With Data

- Click the Files tab to view the sample_data folder  
- Import the California housing test dataset:

```python
import pandas

housing_data = pandas.read_csv("/content/sample_data/california_housing_test.csv")
housing_data.describe()
```

- View the dataset:

```python
housing_data
```

## Practice Question: Importing Data

- Import the california_housing_train dataset  
- Use describe() to summarize the data

## Getting Data From Your Drive

- In the Files tab, mount your Google Drive  
- Upload a CSV file to a folder  
- Import the data using pandas

## Practice Question: Importing Your Own Data

- Import a CSV file from your drive  
- Use describe() to explore the dataset

## Where Is Your Notebook Saved?

- All work is automatically saved to Google Drive  
- Notebooks are stored in the Colab Notebooks folder

## Sharing and Collaborating

- Share notebooks with a link and set permissions  
- Access notebooks later from Google Drive  
- Download notebooks as .ipynb or .py files

## Conclusion

Google Colab provides a powerful and accessible platform for data science and AI projects. Its pre-configured environment and collaboration features make it ideal for learning and practice.
